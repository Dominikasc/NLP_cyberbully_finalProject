# NLP_cyberbully_finalProject
Final Project of the second 12-week cycle in the Frauenloop Machine Learning track, involving methods that we learned in this cycle: 

**Research Question**: How toxic are the discussions around climate crisis in Twitter
**Task**: Create a model, which detects cyberbullying in tweets and classifies sexist, racist, aggressive, toxic and attacking tweets based on Elsafoury, Fatma (2020), [“Cyberbullying datasets”](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saurabhshahane/cyberbullying-dataset?select=aggression_parsed_dataset.csv). 

**Methods I try and why**:
- Compare TFIDF with Word2vec to preprocess dataset for classification. I am trying two different approaches, one statistical approach and one learning approach
- Compare random forest with xgboost, using random forest as baseline for the classification

**Further questions**:
- Which of the classifications is easier to distinguish?
